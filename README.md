# Change_PC_IP
Easily and quickly change your computer's IP address
Using the campus intranet in the laboratory and the intranet in the dormitory requires changing the address of the network card, which is very cumbersome, and can be achieved by using this script: quickly switch the writing of static IP addresses and replace the DHCP mode

The IP address modified in this code applies to the internal network of MKU, and if necessary, you can modify it according to your own internal network

Note that administrator privileges are required because the NIC needs to be modified

It is only for exchange and learning use, if there is any infringement, please contact and it will be deleted immediately
Do not use this script for profit-making scenarios
